Mostafa asks: When we make changes in the feature branch and push it
to origin-feature and pulling it to the origin develop branch,
what do we do next? just fetch on intelliJ and update and it is merged
automatically in our local develop, or we have to merge the remote develop branch
in the local one manually?
