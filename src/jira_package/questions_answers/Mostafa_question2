Mostafa asks: When we make changes in the feature branch and push it
to origin-feature and pulling it to the origin develop branch,
what do we do next? just fetch on intelliJ and update and it is merged
automatically in our local develop, or we have to merge the remote develop branch
in the local one manually?

Mostafa's answer: I'm answering myself Lol. I just tried it,
and after pulling the feature branch (that I'm naming Mostafa) in origin Develop,
all what I had to do on intelliJ is to fetch
and checkout to remote develop and that's it.
I didn't need to update the local develop, it was already updated.
Does this mean that fetching include also updating?
If you have time try it from your side and let me know if the same thing happens.
