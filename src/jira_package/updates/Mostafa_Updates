Hi everyone,
In order to practise the keyboard and prepare what to say in the interview
I created this package where we can share our updates regarding the projects
and studies in general.
Today the only thing I did is creating this project.
I will try to write the rest of my User Story's test cases this evening,
and do one of the 3 java tasks that Donjeta assigned to us.
As for Maps Collections and Exceptions I didn't yet watch the videos and
I didn't have a look on Saim's tasks.
