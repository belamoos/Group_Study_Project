Questions / Answers package
Hi everyone, in order to collaborate and practise Git at the same time
I created this project as a test to see if it's gonna work.
As it is impossible to delete the history
of commits and in order to keep the history
clear and more readable I suggest the following:

1- To ask a question it's better to create a file or a class
and name it with your name followed by the word "question"
and the ordinal number of your question:
    Example of a file or class name: "Mohamed_question1" / "Mohamed_question2".
2- To answer a question it's better to answer inside the file
or class that contain the question, and write a line before answering.
   it is also good to write "your name" in the beginning of your answer:
    Example:
    ---------------------------------------------------------------------
    "Harun's answer: ...
    ...
    ....
    ....
    ...                                     "
    ----------------------------------------------------------------------

    I think choosing the right names and titles is good
    for us in the beginning so we can track our contributions
    and understand the flow of updates. Hope that it works.
    Good luck everyone!
